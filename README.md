# Lemonade-Stand-Agent
Agentic AI assistant that performs comparisons of nearby sources of Lemonade on price, distance, and ratings.
Code is a work in progress and will be uploaded later.
Basic flow:
1. User: enters current location and other requirements and requests best nearby source of lemonade.
5. Response: Shows user a map of nearby sources of lemonade and rating/pricing/operating hours information.
2. Response is generated by LLM with React building a plan to create a list of options and plot them on the map.
3. Use tools for searching for sources of lemonade, determining rating, pricing, operating hours, etc.
4. Then plot optimal nearby locations on map and return map to user.
